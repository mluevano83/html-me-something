        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>A party of little renown has gathered in Phandalin answering a call for aide from a vague Dwarven acquiantance. Once merely co-workers, they now rely on each other to navigate the dangers of the Forgotten Realms and defeat the mysterious Black Spider.</p>

        <h2>The Party</h2>

        <h3 class = "partymember">Quaaalg the Half-Orc</h3>
        <p>Aside from a claim that he is the best-looking of his litter, the only thing his companions know about Quaaalg the Barbarian is that he reveres the Cleric Immaril and calls him "Holy man."</p>   
        
        <h3 class = "partymember">Stumbleduck the Gnome</h3>
        <p>A young monk from parts unknkown. Stumbleduck left her home at an early age to beg the monks of Blorgadorg to teach her their myserious ways in order to protect her people from an ominous, oncoming evil.</p>
        
        <h3 class = "partymember">Avriel the Half-Elf</h3>
        <p>Abandoned as a baby in the Shmorgas Forest, Avriel was found by druids that dwelt deep in the woods. The Firbolg druids among them quickly identified her natural affinity for the druidic arts and raised her in their peculular traditions.</p>
        
        <h3 class = "partymember">Bagheera the Human</h3>
        <p>A businesswoman through and through, Bagheera is perhaps the most dangerous member of the group. Her only real allegiance is to her bottom line.</p>
        
        <h3 class = "partymember">Immaril the Elf</h3>
        <p>How anyone, let alone a Cleric, can maintain a connection to their patron diety while in such a constant state of innebriation is beyond comprehension</p>
